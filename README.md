# Real-Time Personalized Recommendation Engine

**Business Problem**:
In today's highly competitive e-commerce landscape, delivering personalized and timely shopping experiences is paramount to success. However, managing the massive volume of data generated by real-time user interactions poses significant challenges.

**Quantifying the Challenge**:

- Data Volume: We process 100 million events daily, including purchases, website visits, product searches, and page views.
- Peak Load: During peak seasons like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, event volume can triple to 300 million events daily.
- Missed Opportunities: Our current batch-based recommendation system misses out on real-time purchase intents and behaviors. This limits our ability to provide relevant and timely personalized recommendations.
